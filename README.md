# PoC - Dependency injection in React

A hook to make managing dependencies easier.  
A single origin entry point for dependencies

### Why

For fun

### Extension

- Add factory and/or configuration for dependencies, 
  - arguments
  - configuration
- Add boundaries or permissions to dependencies
- Add a factory to make configurating the hook easier. I.e. a factory where a user supplies a dependency configuration, which returns the fully configured hook without needing to create and supply your own DependencyMap
- Add support for functions along with classes
